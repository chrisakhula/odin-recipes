    <h1>Kachumbari</h1>
    <img src="../images/Kachumbari.jpeg">
    <p>Kachumbari takes the accolade of most delicious salad of Kenya. Trust me when I say kachumbari is the epitome of simplicity. It is so simple you can whip it up in no time.</p>
    <p>Serve Kachumbari as a side dish or condiment for pilau rice, kenyan grilled meat known as "Nyama Choma" or even Mutura.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh ripe tomatoes</li>
            <li>onions</li>
            <li>green/red pepper</li>
            <li>lemon juice</li>
            <li>coriander</li>
            <li>Avocado</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash all the vegetables required for making Kachumbari then pat them dry with a disposable kitchen towel.</li>
            <li>Chop the onions finely, add them in a bowl of salted water and wash for about a minute. This process eliminates the pungent and bitter taste present in the onions. It also makes the milder and more flavorful.</li>
            <li>Chop all other ingredients and add them in a large bowl</li>
            <li>Add the lime juice, olive oil and salt to taste and you're good to go.</li>
        </ol>
